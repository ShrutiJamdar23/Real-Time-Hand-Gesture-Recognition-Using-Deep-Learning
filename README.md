# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
 Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning is a system that detects and classifies hand gestures from a live video feed using a webcam. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to recognize gestures like thumbs up, stop, or peace in real time.
